# Automated-Release-Calendar---Public
Create an automated graphical release calendar in a Google Sheet
- Using a configuration tab to identify the calendar range you can:
- Build a graphical calendar to track multiple environments, multiple releases and color each release independently
- If releases slip, use the power of a speadsheet to slide other releases as well (think date of last release + a number of days)
- in addition, you can display notes in the calendar for items of interest
- see the example spreadsheet linked below
